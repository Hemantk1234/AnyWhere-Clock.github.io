This project was bootstrapped with [HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPTüöÄ](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br/>

## ‚≠ê Introduction

This is a simple clock that shows the time in different time zones. It is a simple project that I made to practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.
<br/>
In this Web Application, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used HTML to create the structure of the Web Application. I used CSS to style the Web Application. I used JavaScript to make the clock work.

- Users are able to see the time in different time zones.
- Users can set Alarm.
- Users can set Timer.
- Users can set Stopwatch, etc.
and more...
I hope you like it!
